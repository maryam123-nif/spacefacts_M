            "A Day on Venus is Longer Than a Year: Venus has an extremely slow rotation on its axis, taking about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation, while it takes only about 225 Earth days to orbit the Sun.",
            "There are More Stars in the Universe Than Grains of Sand on Earth: The universe is vast, with billions of galaxies, each containing millions or billions of stars.",
            "Neutron Stars Can Spin at a Rate of 600 Rotations Per Second: These incredibly dense remnants of supernova explosions can rotate extremely rapidly.",
            "There May Be a Planet Made of Diamonds: 55 Cancri e, a planet twice the size of Earth, is thought to have a surface made largely of diamond.",
            "The Largest Known Volcano is on Mars: Olympus Mons is about 13.6 miles high, making it nearly three times the height of Mount Everest.",
            "Space is Not Far Away: The Kármán line, which is the boundary of space, is only 100 kilometers (62 miles) above sea level.",
            "The Moon is Moving Away from Earth: Each year, the Moon drifts about 3.8 centimeters further away from our planet.",
            "A Year on Mercury is Just 88 Days Long: Due to its proximity to the Sun, Mercury has a very short orbital period."
